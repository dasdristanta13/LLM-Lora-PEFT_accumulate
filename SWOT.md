## Strengths
- **Existing default base knowledge**: LLMs have a broad knowledge base and can answer a wide range of questions effectively.
- **Blending**: LLMs can blend different types of knowledge, allowing for unique capabilities like explaining complex concepts in a specific style.
- **Human language translation/Multilingualism**: LLMs can understand and generate text in multiple languages, facilitating translation tasks.

## Weaknesses
- **Lack of custom fine-tuning tools**: Current tools for customizing and fine-tuning LLMs to specific use cases are limited.
- **Insufficient tools for training data preparation**: Limited tools for structuring training data, especially conversational data that is mostly unstructured.
- **Challenges in sourcing and structuring training data**: Difficulty in obtaining high-quality training data, as using synthetic data generated by LLMs is not optimal.
- **Default state not enterprise-ready**: LLMs may produce incorrect or hallucinated responses, making them unsuitable for many enterprise applications.
- **Ongoing management of custom fine-tuning**: The need to manage the complete lifecycle of fine-tuned models and ensure replicability.

## Opportunities
- **Continuous R&D of models**: Anticipated advancements in LLM capabilities, such as integrating voice, images, videos, and text.
- **Easier bootstrapping of chatbot solutions**: Simplifying the process of creating complete chatbot solutions using LLM technology.
- **Foundation for innovation**: LLMs can serve as a foundation for developing new products and services, enabling innovation.
- **Increased automation of chatbot development**: As LLMs evolve, more automation opportunities will arise in chatbot development and management.
- **Autonomous dialog state management**: LLMs can potentially contribute to reducing the labor-intensive process of developing and managing dialog states.
- **Automation via Prompt Engineering**: Leveraging prompt engineering techniques to manipulate customer conversations as engineered prompts for LLMs.

## Threats
- **Data governance challenges**: Managing personally identifiable information (PII) and adhering to data protection and governance regulations within LLM systems.
- **Cost with rising usage**: As the usage of LLMs increases, the associated costs may impact operational expenses.
- **Limited LLM providers**: The number of LLM providers is currently limited, but efforts are being made to address this through open-source initiatives and emerging low-cost providers.
- **Geographic/regional availability**: Certain models or functionalities may not be available in specific geographic regions.
- **Unpredictable and inconsistent output**: There is a need for greater predictability and consistency in LLM responses.
- **Hallucination and inaccurate data**: LLMs may generate inaccurate or false information, posing challenges for production-level implementations.
- **Availability of minority human languages**: The availability of LLM support for minority languages may be limited.
